                This plugin is used to add, remove and manage publicdashboard. A publicdashboard is a user 
                dashboard that can be viewed publicly by any user.

            <subsection name="Configuration">
                <p>
                In Back-Office, you can access the page Dashboard Gestion to add or remove publicdashboard.
                You can also change the order in which they appear.
                In the publicdashboard.properties, the property publicdashboard.encrypt indicates if the user_id
                must be decrypted or not. The property is at false by default.
                For a publicdashboard to be add, the class must implement the IPublicDashboardComponent and be
                injected into the _context.xml file.
                </p>

                <p>

                Portal.jsp?page=publicdashboard&amp;view=getDashboards&amp;id=
                The id_user must be encrypted if the property publicdashboard.encrypt is at true
                To encrypt the id_user, you must use the method encryptRsa in the RsaService class
                from the lutece core.
